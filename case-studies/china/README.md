* To ensure food security in mariculture, China has put forward the “Blue Granary” strategy, which aims to improve the output and quality of marine aquatic products while maintaining the protection of the marine ecological environment. (Han & Li, 2015; Yu & Han, 2020)

## **Purpose of the study**

**Answering the question: Whether seaweed & shellfish cultivation could help Solving-FCB ? If so, how?**

* **Target 1**: Quantify the expansion potential of marine seaweed and bivalves cultivation (Modelling based)
* **Target 2**: Accounting the maximum potential of carbon naturalization by seaweed and bivalves cultivation (Modelling based)
* **Target 3**: Validating the habitat provision services provided by seaweed and bivalves cultivation (including their infrastructures) (Survey and sampling based)
* **Target 4**: Quantify the impact of climate change on seaweed cultivation production/ecosystem service potential (Modelling based).

{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
* Where are these suitable areas?
* How they are distributed?

#### **Target 1 – Feasibility**

* Quantify the expansion potential of marine seaweed and bivalves cultivation
  * Expected results：
    * Marine environment suitability map for seaweed & bivalve cultivation (in China);
  * Method:
    * Species Distribution modelling (Oyinloala, 2018, 2022)

### Target 2

Accounting the maximum potential of carbon naturalization by seaweed and bivalves cultivation

**What’s the maximum carbon neutralization potential by seaweed farming? And for “charismatic carbon”?**

{% columns fullWidth="true" %}
{% column %}
#### **Target 2 – Feasibility**

* Accounting the maximum potential of carbon neutralization and acidification treatment by seaweed and bivalves cultivation
  * Expected results：
    * Potential production (carbon reservation) map for seaweed and bivalves cultivation.
  * Method:
    * Integrated cultivation suitability (e.g. species distribution modelling in target 1) and biophysical production modelling.
  * Data sources:
    * Public databases (marine environmental data), publications (farming species growth data)
